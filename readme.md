# Introduction
![model](./teaser/badetoverview.png)
Currently, existing state-of-the-art 3D object detectors are in two-stage paradigm. These 
methods typically comprise two steps: 1) Utilize a region proposal network to propose a handful 
of high-quality proposals in a bottom-up fashion. 2) Resize and pool the semantic features from
the proposed regions to summarize RoI-wise representations for further refinement. Note that 
these RoI-wise representations in step 2) are considered individually as uncorrelated entries when fed 
to following detection headers. Nevertheless, we observe these proposals generated by step 1) offset 
from ground truth somehow, emerging in local neighborhood densely with an underlying probability. 
Challenges arise in the case where a proposal largely forsakes its boundary information due to 
coordinate offset while existing networks lack corresponding information compensation mechanism. 
In this paper, we propose $BADet$ for 3D object detection from point clouds. Specifically, instead 
of refining each proposal independently as previous works do, we represent each proposal as a node 
for graph construction within a given cut-off threshold, associating proposals in the form of 
local neighborhood graph, with boundary correlations of an object being explicitly exploited. Besides, 
we devise a lightweight Region Feature Aggregation Module to fully exploit voxel-wise, pixel-wise, 
and point-wise features with expanding receptive fields for more informative RoI-wise representations. 
We validate BADet both on widely used KITTI Dataset and highly challenging nuScenes Dataset.
As of Apr. 17th, 2021, our BADet achieves on par performance on KITTI 3D detection leaderboard and 
ranks $1^{st}$ on $Moderate$ difficulty of $Car$ category on KITTI BEV detection leaderboard.

- `spconv` (v1.0)

# Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile C++/CUDA modules in mmdet/ops by running the following command at each directory, *e.g.*
```bash
$ cd mmdet/ops/points_op
$ python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
3. Setup following Environment variables, you may add them to ~/.bashrc:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/qianrui/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/spconv;
```

# Data Preparation
1. Download the 3D KITTI detection dataset from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d). Data to download include:
    * Velodyne point clouds (29 GB): input data to VoxelNet
    * Training labels of object data set (5 MB): input label to VoxelNet
    * Camera calibration matrices of object data set (16 MB): for visualization of predictions
    * Left color images of object data set (12 GB): for visualization of predictions

2. Create cropped point cloud and sample pool for data augmentation, please refer to [SECOND](https://github.com/traveller59/second.pytorch).

3. Split the training set into training and validation set according to the protocol [here](https://xiaozhichen.github.io/files/mv3d/imagesets.tar.gz).

4. You could run the following command to prepare Data:
```bash
$ python3 tools/create_data.py

# Pretrained Model
You can download the pretrained model [\[Model\]](https://www.icloud.com.cn/iclouddrive/0b3sjFxx1UwVz5jglDx44l3CQ#epoch%5F50)[\[Archive\]](https://www.icloud.com.cn/iclouddrive/070z4g1Id3jSI0RCuZiq6Orkw#BADet), 
which is trained on the train split (3712 samples) and evaluated on the val split (3769 samples) and test split (7518 samples). 
The performance (using 11 recall poisitions) on **validation** set is as follows:
